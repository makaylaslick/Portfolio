            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Makayla Slick, and I am studying Spatial Data Science with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Oregon. I expect to graduate in June of 2025. Currently, I am interning at Portland General Electric as a Remote Sensing and Computer Science intern, where I apply my skills in data analysis, GIS analysis, and programming to solve wildfire and other utility related issues, and working with remote sensing technologies.</p>
            <p>I am an environmentalist and love outdoor recreation including hiking and snowboarding, but also seek ways to address environmental issues. I study a lot about climate change, the effects they have on marine life, as well as different unethical practices surrounding animal agricultural. This, in combination with my love for the outdoors, has sparked my interest and drew me to spatial data science!</p>
            <p>A project I am currently a part of is working on creating a potential fire risk index for Portland General Electric territories using data analysis modules in Python to organize the data, creating models to understand fire risk from DEMs, LiDAR, slope, elevation data, and satellite imagery. This information is being used to target specific regions with priority to remove vegetation close to power lines and predict areas of outages. I am on the remote sensing team at PGE and have worked closely with the data analysis and wildfire teams. This project has allowed me to put to use a variety of skills I have, while also being able to learn many new skills surrounding data analysis, utilizing remote sensing technology, GIS analysis, and push my own studies on the components that go into making a potential fire risk model.</p>
            <p>I enjoy spatial data science because it allows me to apply a variety of tools to understand processes that help us understand how environmental issues have occurred and, more importantly, actionable ways to address them. I have really enjoyed working in my internship because I have been able to utilize skills I have acquired through my coursework and has allowed me to expand my skill set exponentially. I also enjoy working with multiple teams of people to tackle different projects and am very excited to join the workforce to continue doing this work!</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Comparing High Risk Fire Zone and Study Area to Understand Fire Spread</h3>
                <p>Utilized ArcGIS Pro and the Python library geopandas to perform DEM, slope, and elevation analysis of the Camp Creek Fire area, compared to a study site, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the terrain and potential fire spread in high-risk fire zones in PGE territories.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Machine Learning Model to Predict Location Data</h3>
                <p>Created a machine learning model to predict the coordinates of an individual, and if they would be skipping class on a given day and time that the user would enter, based on the day of the week, time of day, and temperature high of that day. Required three months of data collection, and utilized a random forest classifier (data obtained from a very close consenting and eager friend).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Predictive Fire Height Based on Cause of Fire</h3>
                <p>Wrote a custom Python program using classes that enabled users within the company to assess the likelihood of a fire reaching a specific height, enhancing safety and preparedness measures at PGE. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>SQL Queries</h3>
                <p>Constructed queries in SQL to extract closed work orders from a data lake that are from high risk fire zones in PGE territories and then sorted the data by a variety of specifications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Utilizing R to Find Trends in COVID's Effect on Reproductive Rates</h3>
                <p>Wrote a program in R to graph COVID cases and reproduction rates and compared this data across all 7 continents and performed statistical analysis; using data cleaning, analysis, and manipulation, to then create multivariate graphs.</p>
